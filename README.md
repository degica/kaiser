# Kaiser

Welcome to Kaiser! Kaiser will mind-control all your monsters and make them even more effective.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'kaiser', git: "https://github.com/degica/kaiser"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install specific_install
    $ gem specific_install -l https://github.com/degica/kaiser

## Usage

You will need to provide a Kaiserfile, and write a Dockerfile for your app (in the app repo's root dir) like so:

```ruby
# Example for a Rails app

dockerfile "Dockerfile.kaiser"

db "mysql:5.6",
  port: 3306,
  data_dir: "/var/lib/mysql",
  params: "-e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=test123",
  commands: ""

app_params "-e DATABASE_URL=mysql2://root:test123@<%= db_container_name %>"

expose "9000"
db_reset_command "bin/rails db:reset"

```

```dockerfile
FROM ruby:alpine

COPY . /app
RUN apk update && apk add build-base
RUN gem install bundler
RUN bundle install

EXPOSE "3000"

CMD ["sh", "-c", "rails -b 0.0.0.0 -p 3000"]
```

Then go to your repo's root folder and go

```sh
bundle exec kaiser init myapp
bundle exec kaiser up
```

Once its done, simply

```sh
open http://myapp.localhost.labs.degica.com
```

And enjoy previewing your app!

### Debugging

You can also debug by going

```sh
bundle exec kaiser attach
```

### Run stuff in the container

You can also run stuff inside by going

```sh
bundle exec kaiser attach sh
```

And you can do anything inside the container

### Save database state

```sh
bundle exec kaiser db_save customer_setup
```

### Load database state

```sh
bundle exec kaiser db_load customer_setup
```

### Curious?

You can see what Kaiser is doing under the hood with the `-v` flag:

```sh
bundle exec kaiser -v db_reset 
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
